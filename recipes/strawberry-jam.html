          <ul>
            <li>1 (generous) cup of strawberries, or mix of berries, for 1 cup of sugar.</li>
            <li>With 3 cups of berries/sugar: 1/4 cup of lemon juice.</li>

          <p class='p-title'>Steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Put a plate in your freezer ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Start sterilizing jars: boil jar in water for 15 mins, or in the over at 350 for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Put berries, sugar and lemon (if needed) all together in a pot.</li>
            <li>Start cooking the mix on medium / high and stir frequently.</li>
            <li>Bring it to a boil, then put it on low.</li>
            <li>When the mix is getting thick, put drops of it on the cold plate.</li>
            <ul class="sub-list">
              <li>If the drops run a lot, the mix has not cooked enough.</li>
              <li>If the drops run a bit, slowly, the mix has cooked the right amount.</li>
              <li>If the drops don't run at all, the mix is too thick (which may be fine if you want a thick jam).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When it's ready, put the jam while it's still hot into the hot jars. </li>
            <li>Depending of the type of jars, heat will seal them. Otherwise, boil the full jars to completely seal them.</li>

          </ol>

        <p class='p-title'>Tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We can cut back on sugar at the beginning, but just a little, not too much. Otherwise, there won't be enough sugar for the jam to set.</li>
          <li>If the jam ends up cooking for a bit too long and is thicker than desired, cook (or microwave) some more berries to a liquidy state. Insert little by little the liquid into the thick jam.</li>
